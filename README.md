# UsedCar-Price-Prediction

This project consists of a business system using machine learning with the objective of predicting the price of used cars based on their characteristics, using regression models. It also includes the development of a Business Intelligence (BI) system in PowerBI, based on the model's predicted results.

## Overview

This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, progressing through its 6 phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.
